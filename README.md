## Project Description

The UART 4-BIT LATCH ALU is a digital system designed to reduce the number of inputs required for input data and minimize the number of outputs needed to obtain the output data. It comprises:

1. Dual 4-Bit Latch.
2. 4-Bit ALU.
3. UART Transmitter.

With these components, the system is capable of receiving data using 4 bits for two operands, which leaves room for using 4 bits to select which operation it's going to perform by the ALU. The output is driven by an 8-bit UART transmitter, which reduces the number of output bits needed to obtain the operation result. The data can be read using any UART interface, which is common among microcontrollers or other standalone UART interfaces.

## Design Components

### Dual 4-Bit Latch
<p align="center">
  <img src="dual%20four%20bit%20latch.svg" alt="Dual Four Bit Latch" width="850">
</p>

This module serves as a 4-bit dual latch system, designed to capture and retain input data on the rising edge of the clock signal (clk). Upon activation of the save_a_n signal, data is stored in latch A, providing a mechanism for temporary data storage. Similarly, when the save_b_n signal is triggered, the module saves data in latch B, facilitating independent data storage in two separate registers. If both save signals are activated simultaneously, no data will be saved due to the NAND design which triggers the multiplexers.

In the event of a reset condition, indicated by the reset_n signal, both latches are cleared, causing the stored data to be reset to zero. It's essential to note that the use of D-type flip-flops for data storage ensures data integrity during normal operation. However, as with most volatile memory elements, data stored in the latches is lost upon power-off, as the memory contents are not persistent.
#### Simulation

Simulation was conducted using Quartus Prime Lite software, employing a 50 MHz clock with a 20 ns period for the clk signal. The remaining signals were simulated with random values.

As observed in the simulation, when the reset_n signal is high, the output q_a and q_b transition to zero, indicating that the registers have been cleared. Additionally, we can observe how values change in memory when save_a_n or save_b_n are triggered.

### UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)

The UART module facilitates asynchronous serial communication between the system and other devices. It handles the transmission and reception of data in a serial format.

#### Simulation

Simulate the UART module to validate its proper operation, including transmitting and receiving data asynchronously.

### Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

The ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations on 4-bit data. It supports operations such as AND, OR, addition, and subtraction, providing essential computational capabilities for the design.

#### Simulation

Utilize Verilog simulation to test the ALU's functionality, ensuring correct operation for all supported arithmetic and logical operations.

### Top Module

The top module integrates the 4-bit latch, UART, and ALU to create the complete design. It orchestrates the interaction between these components to achieve the desired functionality.

#### Simulation

Simulate the top module to verify the overall behavior of the design. Test various input scenarios to ensure proper data processing and communication.

## Possible Arithmetic Operations

The ALU can perform the following arithmetic and logical operations on input data:

1. **AND:** Performs a bitwise AND operation between the input data.
2. **OR:** Performs a bitwise OR operation between the input data.
3. **Addition:** Computes the sum of the input data.
4. **Subtraction:** Computes the difference between the input data.

## Simulation

You can simulate the design using a Verilog-compatible simulation environment. Make sure to create a comprehensive testbench to verify the correct operation of the design under different scenarios.

## Resources Employed

- **OpenLane:** Used to automatically compile ASIC files.
- **Verilog:** Hardware description language used to implement the design.
- **Verilog Simulator:** Employed to verify the functionality of the design through simulations.
